<!-- 
Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a
restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and
300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
Your tasks:
1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for
this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement � (If it's easier for you, you can
start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary
operator!)
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value
(bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value
316.25”
Test data:
§ Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
Hints:
§ To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
§ Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 �

    <div class="tip">

    <button onclick="tip()">Tip</button>
    <p id="result"></p>
    <script>
        function tip() {
            var bill = document.getElementById("bill").value;
            var tip = bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
            var result = document.getElementById("result");
            var total = parseFloat(bill) + parseFloat(tip);
            result.innerHTML = "The bill was " + bill + ", the tip was " + tip + ", and the total value " + total;
        }
